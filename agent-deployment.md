Here is an example of an `agent-deployment.yaml` file for deploying the agent pods in a Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: agent
  namespace: <namespace_name>
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: agent
        image: <agent-image>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: AGENT_CONFIG
          value: <agent-config>
```

In this example, the `agent-deployment.yaml` file defines a Kubernetes deployment for the agent pods. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- `apiVersion` and `kind`: Specify the API version and resource type for the deployment.

- `metadata`: Contains the metadata for the deployment, including the name and namespace.

- `spec`: Defines the specifications for the deployment, including the number of replicas, selector labels, and the template for the pod.

- `replicas`: Specifies the desired number of replicas for the agent pods.

- `selector`: Defines the labels that match the pods managed by the deployment.

- `template`: Specifies the pod template for the agent pods.

- `metadata`: Contains the metadata for the pod template, including the labels.

- `spec`: Defines the specifications for the pod template, including the container configuration.

- `containers`: Specifies the container configuration for the agent pods.

- `name`: Specifies the name of the container.

- `image`: Specifies the container image for the agent pods.

- `ports`: Specifies the container ports that should be exposed.

- `env`: Specifies environment variables for the agent pods.

- `name`: Specifies the name of the environment variable.

- `value`: Specifies the value of the environment variable.

Make sure to replace `<namespace_name>`, `<agent-image>`, and `<agent-config>` with the appropriate values for your specific setup.

Once you have created the `agent-deployment.yaml` file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f agent-deployment.yaml -n <namespace_name>
```

This will deploy the agent pods to the specified namespace in your Kubernetes cluster.
