Here is an example of a `command-center-service.yaml` file for exposing the command and control center using Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: command-center
  namespace: <namespace_name>
spec:
  selector:
    app: command-center
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

In this example, the `command-center-service.yaml` file defines a Kubernetes service for the command and control center. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- `apiVersion` and `kind`: Specify the API version and resource type for the service.

- `metadata`: Contains the metadata for the service, including the name and namespace.

- `spec`: Defines the specifications for the service, including the selector labels, ports, and the service type.

- `selector`: Specifies the labels that match the pods managed by the service.

- `ports`: Specifies the ports that should be exposed by the service.

- `protocol`: Specifies the protocol for the port (TCP in this case).

- `port`: Specifies the port number that should be exposed by the service.

- `targetPort`: Specifies the port number on the pods that the service should forward traffic to.

- `type`: Specifies the type of service. In this example, it is set to `LoadBalancer`, which creates an external load balancer to expose the service.

Make sure to replace `<namespace_name>` with the appropriate value for your specific setup.

Once you have created the `command-center-service.yaml` file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f command-center-service.yaml -n <namespace_name>
```

This will create the service for the command and control center in the specified namespace in your Kubernetes cluster.
